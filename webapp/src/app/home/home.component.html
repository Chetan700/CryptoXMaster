      KuCoin -- End of Life Notice
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>
        I have decided to end of life the KuCoin scanner. Less than 1% of the connections
        to this site are for KuCoin, and due to some initial design choices, it makes it
        harder to build enhancements into the Binance scanner.
      </p>
      <p>
        It may come back in the future when I've built in better support for a multi-exchange
        scanner. But for now this scanner will remain, I'll restart it when it gets glitchy
        but no further work will be done on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a left a copy of the KuCoin scanner running at an alternate URL. I will restart
        it as needed but do not plan to maintain it.

            Along the theme of making this scanner MIT license, I have removed the high of HighCharts
            with the MIT licensed Chart.js. I'm not sure how useful these charts are, they are only used
            for the <b>ticker</b> and the <b>order book</b>.
            <br/>
            Candlestick charts are still provided by the Trading View widget, but thats more of an embed link than
            actually pulling the code into the project.

          <li>Previously a GET request was made to the scanner every second to update the order book. Now an initial
            request will be done to seed the order book but then a websocket is opened to Binance to get order book
            updates. The primary reason here was to reduce some load on my server. But order books updates should be
            more timely now, if even only by a few milliseconds.

            The goal is to work it into some sort of alert/indicator.
            <br/>
            Unfortunately net volume is not persisted between restarts of
            the
            backend due to lack of memory on the server. This will be
            addressed
            soon.
